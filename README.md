# Treeft
Is a thrifting platform for all NUS students staying in residences (Halls, Residential Colleges etc). Students are able to sell or purchase residences' necessities from their fellow schoolmates. This can not only allow them to save money, they are also able to reduce wastage by not throwing their unwanted items away when they moved out. 

## Main Features
Please review our documentation for specific details

### 1. Treeft tree
Our Treeft tree will grow with every successful transaction, and we reward both the buyer & seller based on the height of their tree. The taller the tree, the better the visibility of a sellerâ€™s product and reputation of the buyer.

### 2. Notification 
Treeft will notify users of newly listed common products (E.g Fridge, stationary etc.) With just a click on the notification button, you can receive real-time notifications of new listings!
