Apollo 11

## Motivation

Students are constantly moving in and out of NUS’ student residences (Halls, Residential Colleges etc) due to application eligibility and limits and stay periods for different students.

As students move out of their residences, they may leave their unwanted items behind and, forcing their management to dispose of them. This is very prominent especially for international students since they may be unable to bring all their belongings back home after completing their studies in Singapore.

Disposed items can range from accessories to furniture which either leads to increased wastage or workload for the management to dispose of these items. 

As such, we would like to dive deeper into this issue by creating a solution that benefits both the students and management and at the same time, allowing ourselves to gain more experience in the app development field.


## Vision
Treeft will be a shopping application which leverages on the second hand purchases between students in NUS Residences. Since it is an application targeting NUS students, transactions and deliveries can be done smoothly and conveniently.
Treeft separates itself from the crowd with its in built game whereby the Treeft tree ‘grows’ after every transaction through the platform.
Treeft is inspired by the concept of Carousell but with an emphasis on trying to cultivate thrifty students and help to protect the environment with a creative twist.
Ultimately, we envision Treeft to be an irreplaceable app for all student residents, second only to NUS nextbus and uNivUS. With this application, we hope to not only benefit our peers but also help to relieve the management’s workload. Furthermore, we can also help to reduce further wastage and promote recycling among students

## Competitor Research

Carousell: Lack of incentive to use the application and doesn’t cultivate the habit of thrifting. It is just merely a convenient platform for consumers to consumers transactions. 

Forest: It is a productivity app that helps people beat their phone addiction. We incorporate this to our Treeft platform as a way to address the shortcoming of Carousell. 



## Scope of Project

Treeft is a shopping application which provides a browsing interface for users to browse items (More specifically, second hand) which are listed by other users. To enhance the user’s experience, Treeft will also provide a chat function to facilitate transactions. 

In addition, another core function of Treeft is the Treeft tree. Treeft tree is an inbuilt ‘tree’ that ‘grows’ with every transaction conducted via the application itself.

## Features:

Users will utilise this page for browsing and selecting listings.
Information from user’s listing will be stored into a database.
